# Test conventions
Tests of any public functionality are under `tests/`. There are also test modules under (`slicing`'s top level) [src/](./src/). Howevever, those are for testing private functionality only.

Folder & crate names under [tests/](./tests/) start with `slicing_`. That is to differentiate them (as project folders) in VS Code (as compared to similar test folders in the related `ranging` project).
