# ranging 
Abstracted range-based collections in Rust.

Some full qualified trait/struct/module names repeat their parts (hence there is some "stuttering"). So be it.

Tests of any public functionality are under `tests/`. Any test modules acceptable under (ranging's top level) `src/` are for private functionality only.
